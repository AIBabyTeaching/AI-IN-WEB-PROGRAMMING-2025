    "### FastAPI framework primer\n",
    "\n",
    "**FastAPI in a nutshell.** [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is an asynchronous Python web framework that automatically maps HTTP paths to Python callables called *path operations*. Typed request and response models built with [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) provide validation, while async support keeps expensive AI inference calls from blocking the event loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core building blocks\n",
    "1. **Application entry point** — Create a `FastAPI()` instance in `app/main.py` and register startup/shutdown handlers to open or close model clients. [Docs: First Steps](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/)\n",
    "2. **Routers and path operations** — Organize endpoints in `routers/` modules with `APIRouter` to keep chat, embeddings, and admin surfaces separate. Mount each router in `main.py` to expose `/api/chat`, `/api/embeddings`, etc. [Docs: APIRouter](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/)\n",
    "3. **Pydantic models** — Declare request/response schemas in `schemas.py` so prompts, system messages, and model options are validated before invoking inference. [Docs: Request Body](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/body/)\n",
    "4. **Dependency injection** — Use `Depends` to pass shared services (OpenAI client, vector store, cache) into route functions without manually instantiating them. This keeps AI integrations testable and configurable. [Docs: Dependencies](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/)\n",
    "5. **Background tasks** — Offload long-running work such as audit logging, metrics collection, or follow-up summarization via `BackgroundTasks`. Students can immediately see how to chain AI workflows beyond the initial response. [Docs: Background Tasks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/background-tasks/)\n",
    "6. **Interactive OpenAPI docs** — FastAPI generates `/docs` and `/redoc` from your type hints, letting you verify model contracts, stream responses, and share live documentation with teammates. [Docs: Interactive API docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/features/#interactive-api-docs)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tooling and project layout for AI routes\n",
    "- **Local server:** Run `uvicorn app.main:app --reload` for fast feedback while editing routers or schemas. Enable hot reload so AI inference tweaks are visible immediately. [Docs: Uvicorn](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/uvicorn/)\n",
    "- **Environment management:** Load `.env` files with `python-dotenv` or FastAPI settings management to inject API keys, base URLs, and model IDs without hardcoding secrets.\n",
    "- **Folder structure:** Start with `app/main.py`, `app/routers/`, `app/schemas.py`, and `app/services/ai.py`. Keep retry utilities, tracing helpers, and vector database adapters in `services/` so routes remain thin controllers.\n",
    "- **Testing hooks (Optional):** Leverage FastAPI's `TestClient` to write unit tests that mock AI providers and confirm each router handles success, errors, and streaming payloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vite + React framework primer\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Vite for React AI UIs\n",
    "The frontend labs rely on [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) to scaffold a React UI with lightning-fast hot module replacement, native ES module bundling, and first-class TypeScript. CLI commands such as `npm create vite@latest`, `npm install`, `npm run dev`, and `npm run build` (or their `pnpm`/`yarn` equivalents) keep iteration tight while preparing optimized builds for deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core tooling and project conventions\n",
    "- **Dev server workflow:** `npm run dev` launches a Vite server that can [proxy](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-proxy) `/api` calls to FastAPI, eliminating CORS friction while you develop AI features.\n",
    "- **Environment variables:** Prefix keys with `VITE_` (e.g., `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, `VITE_OPENAI_MODEL`) so they are exposed via `import.meta.env`. Use separate `.env.local` files for experimental model toggles.\n",
    "- **Module organization:** Mirror backend routers with feature folders like `src/features/chat/`, `src/features/embeddings/`, and keep shared helpers under `src/lib/` (`apiClient.js`, `retry.js`, `streamParser.js`).\n",
    "- **React hooks and state:** Follow the [React documentation](https://react.dev/learn) to combine `useState`, `useEffect`, and custom hooks that orchestrate fetch lifecycles. Patterns such as `useReducer` for complex prompt builders or `useRef` for streaming buffers keep AI UIs maintainable.\n",
    "- **UI composition:** Component libraries (Mantine, Chakra) or design systems can slot into `src/components/` for reusable chat bubbles, token counters, and loading spinners.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mini walkthrough: bootstrapping the AI stack\n",
    "1. **Scaffold FastAPI** with `python -m venv .venv && pip install fastapi uvicorn` and create `app/main.py` that instantiates the app, registers routers, and mounts static files if needed.\n",
    "2. **Add routers and schemas** under `app/routers/inference.py` with `Pydantic` models describing your prompt payloads and inference responses.\n",
    "3. **Wire dependencies** like model clients via `Depends`, storing credentials in `.env` and loading them with a settings class.\n",
    "4. **Run `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`** to expose `/docs`, test path operations, and confirm background tasks fire during inference.\n",
    "5. **Create the Vite React frontend** with `npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react` and install UI dependencies that render form controls and streaming areas.\n",
    "6. **Configure Vite proxy and envs** in `vite.config.js` and `.env.local` so `fetch` helpers in `src/lib/apiClient.js` point to FastAPI during development.\n",
    "7. **Implement React hooks and components** (e.g., `useInference` in `src/features/chat/useInference.js`) that call the backend, manage retries, and render streaming updates.\n",
    "8. **Iterate locally** by running `uvicorn` and `npm run dev` together, validating requests through the autogenerated FastAPI docs and the Vite dev tools before containerization or deployment.\n"

    "6. Build React components that manage prompt forms, loading indicators, streaming updates, and error toasts tied to those utilities.\n",
    "7. Use Vite's dev server proxy to forward `/api` requests to FastAPI for local iteration, then validate the flow through Docker Compose.\n",
