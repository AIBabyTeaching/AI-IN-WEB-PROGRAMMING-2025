# AI in Web Programming Lab Notebooks

A collection of weekly lab notebooks lives under `ai-web/labs`. Each notebook follows the same structure (objectives, learning outcomes, prerequisites, guided steps, validation checks with local curl commands, and homework extensions) while covering the specific topics from the course brief.

## Backend stack

The backend located at `ai-web/backend` is a FastAPI application served by Uvicorn. A small `EchoIn` Pydantic model validates the JSON payload sent from the frontend, while the `/health` route powers automated curl checks inside each lab. During development the app loads environment variables via `python-dotenv` so keys like `GEMINI_API_KEY` can be provided without committing secrets, and `CORSMiddleware` whitelists the Vite dev server origin for local testing.

## Frontend stack

The React frontend in `ai-web/frontend` is scaffolded with Vite. Components such as `App.jsx` demonstrate hook-based state management, and a reusable helper in `src/lib/api.js` wraps `fetch` calls to the backend. Vite injects `VITE_API_BASE` so the client knows where to send requests when running in Docker or against a deployed API.

## Container orchestration

`docker-compose.yml` builds and runs the frontend and backend containers side by side, publishing ports `5173` and `8000` to the host. The compose file mounts source code for hot reload, forwards `VITE_API_BASE` to the frontend, and points the backend at the `.env` file so secrets like `GEMINI_API_KEY` are loaded consistently.

## Notebook generator

The script `generate_ai_web_lab_notebooks.py` programmatically scaffolds each lab notebook. It ensures sections such as objectives, prerequisites, validation steps, and homework prompts follow a consistent template across the course, making it easier to maintain and extend the curriculum.
